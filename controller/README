All stuff related to the controller goes here.
It includes tracking, motion planner, ... that run on a _super_ computer outside the contest field but next to the two skillful operators.
We run ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Tips:
1) modify your .bashrc to include this line:
source /home/tor/robotics/prj/013/ws/trui-bot-prj/controller/devel/setup.bash
2) ask the Mechanical Team for the mesh files to put under <...>/controller/src/rbmt_urdf/mesh/
3) install ros-navigation stack:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-navigation
